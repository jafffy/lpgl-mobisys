% Recent advances in augmented reality (AR) technology are attracting 
% various emerging industrial and everyday life applications.
% %
% However, resource limitations of untethered HMDs, in particular, the energy 
% constraint of battery-powered devices, can limit the scope of potential applications.
% %
% Hence, a common approach is to lower the visual quality, which however
% trades-off user perceived experience for energy efficiency.
% %
% A key requirement for such applications, then, is to enhance the 
% energy efficiency %of untethered HMD devices
% while minimizing the sacrifice in user experience.

%
We present {\myit}, an OpenGL API compatible \emph{Low-power Graphics Library}
for energy efficient AR headset applications.
%
%Prior to presenting the design of {\myit}, 
We first characterize power consumption patterns of a state of the art 
AR headset, Magic Leap One, and empirically show that its internal GPU is 
the most impactful controllable energy factor.
%
Based on preliminary studies, we design {\myit} so that it uses the 
device's gaze/head orientation information
and geometry data to infer user perception information, 
intercepts application-level graphics API calls, 
and uses frame rate control, mesh simplification, and culling techniques
to enhance energy efficiency of AR headsets without detriment of user experience.
%
%
% We evaluate {\myit} using a prototype implementation on Microsoft HoloLens.
%
Results from a comprehensive set of controlled in-lab experiments and an 
IRB-approved user study with 25 participants
%
%show that {\myit} can reduce the HoloLens' energy usage by $\sim$25\% 
show that {\myit} reduces up to $\sim$22\% of total power while adding only 46$\mu$sec of latency per object with close to no loss in subjective user 
experience.
