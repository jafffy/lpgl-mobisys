\subsection{Controlled in-lab experiments}


The goal of our in-lab experiments is to show how each of {\myit}'s components 
contribute to the overall system performance.
%
To evaluate under realistic scenarios, we gathered 12 male and 5 female college
student volunteers to play the block stacking game (Section~\ref{sec:app})
with two modifications.
%
% First, instead of only using box-shaped blocks, our controlled in-lab experiments 
First, instead of using only box-shaped blocks, we
used cylinder-shaped blocks as well in addition to boxes.
%
While boxes are ideal for the purpose of measuring stereoscopsis levels, they 
are not suitable for validating the effectiveness of our mesh simplification
procedure, since a simplified box will still be a box.
%
Second, while the application for patients asks the users to stack five blocks,
we increase this number to 20 for non-patient users.
%
These changes to the application are made so that we have complex enough 
but controllable contents on the screen for fully utilizing and observing the 
benefits that {\myit}'s components offer.


While the volunteers participate,
we record the timestamp, head position, and head direction to formulate a 
``head tracking sample'' $HT_n$ for each participant.
%
Each $HT_n$ is used as a motion trace that we replay to further analyze the 
system-level performance, and in large, we categorized them into two levels of 
head motion; (1) small amount, and (2) large amount of head motions.
%
%\jk{DO WE NEED THIS? 
%Specifically, the position and direction information in $HT_n$ is translated
%to a translation matrix and rotation matrix, respectively.
%We pass the translation matrix through a linear interpolation and 
%the rotation matrix through a spherical linear interpolation to compute 
%the median value and re-position all the objects. 
%By doing so, we can replay the same display contents on the HoloLens 
%without physically moving the device.
%}
%
Using these traces, we analyze how different component and parameters in {\myit}
%such as binary tree-based mesh simplification, quad tree-based dynamics
%scoring, and culling, 
affects the energy usage performance of the HoloLens.

\spar{Binary Tree-based Mesh Simplification}:
%
We first measure the energy usage rate (mWh/10min) with and without {\myit}.
%
While doing this, we varied the binary tree depth $d_B$ of the mesh 
simplification algorithm to see how much complexity {\myit} can handle.
%
As \fig\ref{fig:meshsimplification-energy} confirms, {\myit} offers an energy
savings of up to $\sim$25\% compared to the case without {\myit}, reducing it
down close to the baseline usage rate ($\sim$490 mWh/10mins) of the 
platform even under minimal workloads.
%
This reduction holds even when a fairly deep binary tree ($d_B$=10) is 
constructed for 20 objects, which implies that our mesh simplification manages
to keep the computation (and energy) costs low.
%
Increasing depth $d_B$ does lead to a slight increase in energy usage since it
results in projecting more ``detailed'' objects, but insignificant up to a 
point where the computational load exceeds what can be handled by
the baseline limit. 
%
After this point, the energy consumption shows a steep increase. 
This is exemplified by a case where we doubled the number of objects on the 
scene (from 20 to 40) with $d_B$=10.

\spar{Frame Rate Control and Quad-tree-based Frame Dynamics Scoring}:
%
Next, we examine the impact of QDS on {\myit}'s energy efficiency by monitoring
how the frame rate changes with different target sensitivity thresholds.
%
Sensitivity of frame rate control can be configured using a set of thresholds 
$DT_n (n=1,2,...)$ that determine at what frame dynamics score the frame rate
will shift to a new value.
%
For this experiment, we selected three frame rate levels: 60, 30 and 15 fps.
%
Then, two dynamics score thresholds $DT_1$ and $DT_2$ will determine the frame
rate transitions between 60--30 fps and 30--15 fps, respectively.
%
Note that it is possible to configure frame rates at finer granularity with
more thresholds.
%
For the purpose of our experiments, we set configurations for
``high-sensitivity'' as [$DT_1$=50, $DT_2$=30], and 
``low-sensitivity'' as [$DT_1$=90, $DT_2$=50].
%
For example, with the high sensitive setting, if the frame dynamics score is 
larger than 50, the frame rate is set to 60 fps, and if less than 30, 15 fps is used.
%
%Whereas for the low-sensitivity case, only frame dynamics scores of higher 
%than 90 will put the system in 60 fps mode.
%
%Note that the scope of this work does not include a scheme to personalize or
%adaptively control this threshold, but we leave this as future work. 



\figs\ref{fig:framedynamics-trace-large} and~\ref{fig:framedynamics-trace-small}
plot how {\myit} changes the frame rate over time for large and small amount of 
head motions, respectively.
%
Here, ``High sensitivity'' {\myit} shows a higher frame rate compared to the
``Low sensitivity" case.
%
Furthermore, by comparing \figs\ref{fig:framedynamics-trace-large} 
and~\ref{fig:framedynamics-trace-small}, we can see that since large motions
lead to frequent empty scenes (user moves view away from blocks and
no object motion is detected) the average frame rate stays lower.
%
\fig\ref{fig:framedynamics-energy} again clearly shows that {\myit} reduces 
the energy usage of the HoloLens.
%
However, the difference between the high and low sensitivity cases are negligible
despite the frame rate differences 
(in Figures ~\ref{fig:framedynamics-trace-large} and~\ref{fig:framedynamics-trace-small}).
%
Again, this is due to the HoloLens' baseline energy. That is, {\myit} lowers 
the energy usage down to a point where it cannot be reduced further.


%This shows an example of how the frame rate can change with different sensitivity settings and we now focus on how such changes affect the energy usage performance using different $HT_n$ samples. Specifically, we select one $HT_n$ with large amounts of motion and another sample with a small amount of motion in the data and set the HoloLens to run at different Quad-tree-based Frame Dynamics Scoring sensitivity configurations. Furthermore, we set a mesh simplification depth of 4 for cylinder blocks with \todo{n} triangles and another case with the mesh simplification option off. We measure the the energy usage of the HoloLens under such configurations. As \fig\ref{fig:framedynamics-energy} shows, with the mesh simplification on, regardless of the frame dynamics sensitivity, the HoloLens saves $\sim$25\% of the energy usage, compared to the case where {\myit} is not used. Results also show that with different sensitivity configurations, \jk{Add results!}

    \vspace{-2ex}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{cullingEnergy}
    \vspace{-2ex}

    \label{fig:culling-energy}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 80 CHAR %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\spar{{\myit} Culling}:
%
To verify the impact of {\myit}'s culling on energy, we test with 
and without {\myit}'s culling component turned on. When it is off, only the 
graphics stack's default culling is used. 
%
\fig\ref{fig:culling-energy} shows that, with small amounts of head motion,
{\myit}'s culling feature indeed offers significant ($\sim$27\%) energy savings.
%
In this case, all 20 blocks will be drawn on the scene for most of the time, 
but a subset of the blocks will move out of the FOV
for short periods when the user is moving the blocks.
This is the time when {\myit}'s culling successfully suppresses their 
processing and lowers the energy consumption. 
%
Unexpectedly, however, when there is large amount of head motion, the default 
culling also shows low energy usage rate.
%
This an effect caused by the peculiarity of our application scenario.
Once a user makes large head movements, already stacked 
existing blocks move out of the scene for long periods.
%(similar to the effect in \figs\ref{fig:framedynamics-trace-large} 
%and~\ref{fig:framedynamics-trace-small}). 
%
At this point, due to the simplicity of the scene \rev{(with no backgrounds)}, 
the graphics pipeline is not doing much work even without {\myit}. Therefore, 
both options consume the baseline energy despite {\myit} suppressing tasks up
to the vertex shader.
%
But as the small amount of head motion case shows, {\myit}'s enhanced culling
is beneficial when there are sufficient number of objects in the scene and the
system operates at the boundary of the baseline workload limit.

\subsection{Computational Latency}


An important factor we should consider besides energy is the latency of the 
algorithms we've designed in {\myit}. If algorithms take long to execute, 
this too can affect the user experience and disrupt application requirements.
%
\fig\ref{fig:dynamicScoringLatency} plots the latencies for computing the 
screen dynamics using various methods. Our scheme, QDS, is compared with 
widely used image-based frame dynamics computing methods such as SSIM and PSNR.
%
To compute at the same granularity, we set $d_Q$ as 16. Here we use a scene 
which consists of a cube in the center. Comparing the first three bars show 
that the latency of QDS-based frame dynamics computation ($\sim90~\mu$sec per frame)
is significantly lower than the SSIM ($\sim$55x) and PSNR ($\sim$7x).
%
The fourth bar, in which we plot the time spent by the PSNR and SSIM schemes 
while copying the frame buffer contents from the GPU to the memory for dynamics 
computation, shows that a large portion of this latency (the majority for 
PSNR; 0.63 of 0.65 msec) is wasted on the memory copy process.
%
This result suggests that our geometry-based approach can
outperform the image-based algorithms. It is especially true for
AR HMDs given that only a small portion of the scene is usually drawn
on the screen compared to VR or mobile AR applications. 


Next, we try adding four additional cubes to the scene and compute the latency
for QDS. The fifth bar in \fig\ref{fig:dynamicScoringLatency} shows that when
more quad trees are constructed to support more objects, the latency of QDS 
increases rapidly.
Nevertheless, from the sixth bar we can see that lowering $d_Q$ to 10 (from 16)
shows a much decreased latency of 0.37 msec.

The latency introduced by the binary tree construction process is presented in 
\fig\ref{fig:octree-latency} for the full-resolution Stanford Bunny with 
$\sim$69K triangles while varying $d_B$.
%
We also present the outcome of the binary tree-based mesh simplification in 
\fig\ref{fig:octree-bunny} for different depths. Results show that the mesh 
simplification process for a full-resolution Stanford Bunny takes less than 
$\sim$80~msec for $d_B\le$11 and the latency converges (at $\sim$140~msec) for 
higher $d_B$ values.
%
Given that these simplified objects will be displayed for objects that are 
\textit{out of} the user's focus range (by more than $\epsilon^\circ$) we can 
see that voxelization effectively simplifies the target objects.
%
%Note that  given the binary tree depth of $d_B$ and $n$ triangles,
%the theoretical complexity is $O((2n)^{d_B})$. Nevertheless, at each step
%{\myit} only checks for vertex inclusions in the binary tree; thus, the
%quantitative results are small enough to induce minimal effect on the user
%experienced latency.

\subsection{Pilot Study with Strabismus Patients}
\label{sec:pilot-study}

Finally, using the application discussed in Section~\ref{sec:app}, we performed 
an IRB-approved pilot study with a total of eight children participants 
(ages 7-10), of which four were diagnosed with strabismus and the other four 
visited the hospital for post-surgical check ups.
%
The purpose of this study was to validate changes in user-perceived object
rendering quality (including user experience) when applying {\myit} with different target quality levels.
%
%\rev{and also to verify that applying {\myit} did not disturb the user experience within the application.}


We started our study by teaching the children how to play the block stacking 
game, and had them get used to controlling objects in the AR environment.
%
In the actual experiment phase, we had each child play three versions of the
block stacking application: one version without {\myit}, {\myit} with 
low-sensitivity QDS thresholds, and {\myit} with high-sensitivity QDS thresholds.
%
This information was not disclosed to the participants and the testing order was
randomized to remove any bias.


% Note that the contents of this game is very simple;
% therefore, there is only a minimal amount of energy savings from the frame rate
% control and mesh simplification. Rather than analyzing the energy usage,
% the purpose was to verify that applying {\myit} did not disturb the user 
% experience within the application context.
%
Using a visual analogue scale (VAS) type of survey (1-5 scale), we collected 
information on (1) whether the participant felt any dizziness, (2) the clarity 
of the blocks, and (3) how comfortable the game was to the eyes.
%
We note that all participants responded with answers of similar patterns
regardless of the test scenario.
%
Quantitatively, for questions (1) and (3), most participants answered with 
a score of 1, indicating that the system was comfortable and there were no 
dizziness. Answers for question (2) were in the range of 1.5-2, suggesting that
the clarity was not perfect but acceptable. Surprisingly, some participants 
answered that {\myit} with low-sensitivity showed the most clear images.
Given that we randomized the experiment sequence, this suggests that frame 
rate changes (for our application) gave minimal effect to the
usability and object quality.


\rev{
We acknowledge that eight children participants are not a large enough and
representative user population to generalize our user study given the broad 
range of AR applications.
%
However, they are unbiased, and we emphasize that the study was performed 
for a real use case at the hospital.
%
We plan to extend our case study to a more diverse set of applications with
larger subjects as part of our future work.
