    abstract = {Most research on ad-hoc wireless networks makes simplifying
assumptions about radio propagation. The ``Flat Earth'' model of the world is
surprisingly popular: all radios have circular range, have perfect coverage
in that range, and travel on a two-dimensional plane. CMU's {\tt ns-2} radio
models are better but still fail to represent many aspects of realistic radio
networks, including hills, obstacles, link asymmetries, and unpredictable
fading. We briefly argue that key ``axioms'' of these types of propagation
models lead to simulation results that do not adequately reflect real
behavior of ad-hoc networks, and hence to network protocols that may not work
well (or at all) in reality. We then present a set of 802.11 measurements
that clearly demonstrate that these ``axioms'' are contrary to fact. The
broad chasm between simulation and reality calls into question many of
results from prior papers, and we summarize with a series of recommendations
for researchers considering analytic or simulation models of wireless
networks.}
